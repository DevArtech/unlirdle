# Unlirdle - The Unlimited Wordle
Have you found yourself wanting play Wordle again after figuring out today's word?  
Well now there's Unlirdle!  
Unlirdle is a constantly randomly generating version of Wordle that allows you to keep on guessing words even after you have figured it out!  

This clone is completely open-source and I do not make any money on this!  

To-Do List:  
 - Seperate word list from JavaScript file (Implement NodeJS)
 - Add new word lists for expanded word lengths
 - Create "infinite" gamemode (When one word has been solved, immediately set a new word and keep going)
